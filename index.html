  <h1>HTML & the Birth of the World Wide Web</h1>
  <p><strong>HTML</strong> stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages.</p>

  <p>HTML was invented by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> in 1991 while he was working at <em>CERN</em>, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.</p>
